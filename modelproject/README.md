# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The AD-AS model** and is about the solution and dynamics of the AD-AS model with Aggregate Demand, Long Run Supply and Short Run Supply. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb). Our **model** is written in [modelproject.py]

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
