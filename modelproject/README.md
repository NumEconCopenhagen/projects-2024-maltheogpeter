# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **AD-AS model** and is about the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model which is a model that describes the relationship between inflation and output

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
