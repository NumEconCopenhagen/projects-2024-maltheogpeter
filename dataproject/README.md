# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data project Fred data** and is about the inflation rate and interest rate in the USA with data collected from FRED

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject2.ipynb](dataproject2.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. fred_rate.csv (*FRED*) 
2. fred_inflation.csv (*FRED*)
2. fred_money_supply.csv (*FRED*)

As well as datasets that consist of merges / splits of these 3 datasetts.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install pandas-datareader``
